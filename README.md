# Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

WORK IN PROGRESS

An interactive version, in the style of Bret Victor's [Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks](https://worrydream.com/ScientificCommunicationAsSequentialArt/), for Leslie Lamport's ["Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System"](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf).

## Elements

This section describes the various elements the paper has and why they are how they are.

### Math

Math is used to give precise and concise representations of ideas which are also described in words (eg: let "m" be the slope of a line).
A reader will have to map the math to the idea in their mind via the math or textual representation.
The information is in the paper but the reader may take time to build the mapping:
- if the reader already knows the mapping, they continue reading
- if the reader does not know the mapping, they either have to
    - go back to find what it presents (eg: go back in the paper to see "let "m" be the slope of a line")
    - spend time understanding what the notation means (eg: "mx + b" means the y-coordinate of the x position)

The paper will already know the mapping but may be far away from the use of the notation.

The math elements allow a reader to switch between the math notation and its textual representation.
This brings the related information close together and allows the reader to understand quicker.
